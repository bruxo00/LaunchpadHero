# LaunchpadHero
A program that allows you to use your Novation Launchpad to play Clone Hero. (only tested on Novation Launchpad MK2, but I think it will work on any Launchpad)

## How to setup

**1st**. Open Clone Hero and change your keyboard bindings to:
- Green Circle: A
- Red Circle: S
- Yellow Circle: D
- Blue Circle: F
- Orange Circle: G
- Strum Up&Down: Arrow UP and Arrow Down, respectively
- Star Bonus: Space
- All the other binds on default

**2nd**. Connect your Launchpad and open Launchpad Hero.

**3rd**. Open Clone Hero. You can use the top arrows and the other binds to navigate in the menus.

**4th**. You can change the bind layout on the Launchpad. Click on the bind you want to change, then click on the pad you want to assign it to.

## Known Issues

The libraries I used haven't been updated in years, so it might have some hidden bugs, but it works if you don't try to break it on purpouse.

- The devices list don't detect the Launchpad if you plug it in after you open the program.
- If you disconnect the Launchpad the program will probably crash
- Don't pick the same pad to multiple binds, it will break. If you want you can send a PR to "fix" this :)
